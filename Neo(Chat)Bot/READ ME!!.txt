for logging on, simply goto file and connect.

To use the commands, enable interbot commands, and put the user control on also.
the wat this works is, when the database window appears, you select the user you
want to give access to, and click ok. to make the bot do things, that selected
user needs to whisper it an interbot command, a bnet command, or just plain text.
to use an interbot command via whisper, you only need to whisper the key work (ex. /w neogenic chaninfo)
to use an interbot command via the main form, you type / before the command (ex. /chaninfo)
when user controls are enabled, EVERYTHING the selected user whispers to the bot, it says on battle.net.

Commands for the Interbot Part Are:
server    - Shows the current server the bot is connected too.
online    - Shows account(s) Logged in and the handle.
home      - Shows the bots current home channel.
version   - Shows the version of the bot your using.

addbuddy  - Adds the selected user from the channel list to your buddy list box.
